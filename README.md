# iceskatingpolarbear
The background is a cute ice mountain with a frozen lake in the middle. 

The characters are polar bears with ice skates. The main objective is to follow the directions which is the choreography. During single player the user uses the arrow section and attempts to follow the arrow directions on the screen. Every time they mess up or do not hit the arrow in time, they lose a point.

When it’s multiplayer the two users have to work together. When ever they don’t follow the synchronized choreography, they lose a point as a team. 

The secondary objective is to feed yourself for energy while ice skating. There will be fish placed around the frozen lake and the goal is to pass through them to eat them. 

The aspects of the game that are determined by the computer and communicated to the user are the arrows for choreography and the placement of the fish. 	
Example for possible background

The game will display arrows near the bottom corner of the screen (both left and right for multiplayer). Every time the user inputs the wrong arrow, the game will show “-1” in red. The display will also have fish randomly placed and whenever the polar bear skates through one, the game will show “+1”. The players start with 3 points and if they lose all 3 points before the end of the level, they did not pass. After each level, a page will appear that rates the success by offering the player extra fish. 

The experimental feature is that the player can use the extra fish for extra points during the game or save them up to buy pretty ice skates. In fact, if the player does not have enough extra fish, they should be prompted to obtain their parents credit card and pay me for more. 

My second experimental feature is climate change. That is left open for interpretation for I am still brainstorming. Feel free to give me any suggestions.

The player uses the up down right and left arrows on the keyboard. During multiplayer, player 2 uses the keys w a s and d.
